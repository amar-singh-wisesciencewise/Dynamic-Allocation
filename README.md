# Dynamic-Allocation
This code has been written to understand the dynamic allocation in linux. Here, I have tried to implement "malloc" and "free" functions exposed by C over an array. There are two codes one, that handles fixed sized block allocation, is good for embedded system where we know the block size. second code - is for dynamic sized allocation and it uses fixed sized allocation code for internal note keeping(list management).
